Hi, this is Yiying Li. I am a PhD student in Henan University doing research in genetics,epigenetics, developmental biology, and evolution. My researcha area is mainly about insect development and reproduction. I used [migratory locust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_locust) (*Locusta migratoria*) as research model, which is the most widespread locust species. My main project is about the functional remodeling of fat body tissue and I focuse on how insect fat body gain the ability to produce a large amount of vitellogenin(Vg) after eclosion. I also participated in another project, I try to figure out about how an orphan gene participates in the competition of male sperm. In the future, I hope to travel to more places around the world, learn more knowledge, and do more interesting research.
