	abstract = {The insect fat body is comparable to the liver and adipose tissue in vertebrates, and plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism, nutrient storage, and reproduction. During metamorphosis, the fat body is disassembled via programmed cell death and cell dissociation. After adult eclosion, the fat body is reconstructed either by repopulation from the remaining juvenile fat body cells or by differentiation from adult progenitor cells. This reconstruction is a prerequisite for initiating the extensive synthesis of vitellogenin (Vg), which is necessary for the maturation of eggs. Despite its significance, the underlying mechanisms of this reconstruction remain inadequately understood. Transcriptome analysis of the fat bodies from migratory locusts at 0-5 days post adult emergence revealed 79 genes associated with chromatin remodeling. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis indicated a positive correlation between chromatin remodeling and fat body reconstitution. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that brahma, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is crucial for post-adult-eclosion fat body development. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the levels of brahma mRNA in the fat body are progressively increased during the previtellogenic stage, then reach the peak and remain elevated in the vitellogenic phase. Furthermore, brahma is expressed in response to gonadotropic juvenile hormone (JH). Knockdown of brahma led to a marked reduction in Vg expression within the fat body, along with arrested ovarian growth. These findings shed light on the involvement of brahmamediated chromatin remodeling in JH-stimulated fat body reconstruction and reproduction of adult female locusts.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs), which play a vital role in regulating gene expression, are prevalent in all organisms and characterization of them may provide important clues for understanding regulation in vivo. The present study reports a genome-wide investigation of TFs in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a worldwide pest of crucifers. A total of 940 TFs distributed among 133 families were identified. Phylogenetic analysis of insect species showed that some of these families were found to have expanded during the evolution of P. xylostella or Lepidoptera. RNA-seq analysis showed that some of the TF families, such as zinc fingers, homeobox, bZIP, bHLH, and MADF\_DNA\_bdg genes, were highly expressed in certain tissues including midgut, salivary glands, fat body, and hemocytes, with an obvious sex-biased expression pattern. In addition, a number of TFs showed significant differences in expression between insecticide susceptible and resistant strains, suggesting that these TFs play a role in regulating genes related to insecticide resistance. Finally, we identified an expansion of the HOX cluster in Lepidoptera, which might be related to Lepidoptera-specific evolution. Knockout of this cluster using CRISPR/Cas9 showed that the egg cannot hatch, indicating that this cluster may be related to egg development and maturation. This is the first comprehensive study on identifying and characterizing TFs in P. xylostella. Our results suggest that some TF families are expanded in the P. xylostella genome, and these TFs may have important biological roles in growth, development, sexual dimorphism, and resistance to insecticides. The present work provides a solid foundation for understanding regulation via TFs in P. xylostella and insights into the evolution of the P. xylostella genome.},

	abstract = {Plutella xylostella exhibits exceptional reproduction ability, yet the genetic basis underlying the high reproductive capacity remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an orphan gene, lushu, which encodes a sperm protein, plays a crucial role in male reproductive success. Lushu is located on the Z chromosome and is prevalent across different P. xylostella populations worldwide. We subsequently generated lushu mutants using transgenic CRISPR/Cas9 system. Knockout of Lushu results in reduced male mating efficiency and accelerated death in adult males. Furthermore, our findings highlight that the deficiency of lushu reduced the transfer of sperms from males to females, potentially resulting in hindered sperm competition. Additionally, the knockout of Lushu results in disrupted gene expression in energy-related pathways and elevated insulin levels in adult males. Our findings reveal that male reproductive performance has evolved through the birth of a newly evolved, lineage-specific gene with enormous po­ tentiality in fecundity success. These insights hold valuable implications for identifying the target for genetic control, particularly in relation to species-specific traits that are pivotal in determining high levels of fecundity.},
